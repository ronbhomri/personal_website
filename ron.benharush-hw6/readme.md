hi, 
you can run my website by double click on the homepage.html file.

the input validation is auto by html using required on the name and the email.

I have 2 js files:
1-gallery- click on each photo makes it active, and it opens fully.
2-cform- checks if the email is valid and if the message sent, there is a message on the screen.

I took some inspiration for my web design from  https://library.elementor.com/cv-portfolio/skills/   
and used some patterns from few courses in udemy.

thank you for the assignment. it was fun!
